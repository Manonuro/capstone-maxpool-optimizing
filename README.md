Project: Capstone-maxpool-optimizing

The Capstone is a two-staged project. The first is the proposal component, where you can receive valuable feedback about your project idea, design, and proposed solution. This must be completed prior to your implementation and submitting for the capstone project.
You can find the capstone proposal rubric here, and the capstone project rubric here. Please ensure that you are following directions correctly before submitting these two stages which encapsulate your capstone.
You will find an open_projects folder in these files. This will be where pre-curated capstone projects are available, should you choose to work on a project already partially designed for you.
Please email machine-support@udacity.com if you have any questions.
In this project, you'll classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. You'll preprocess the images, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. The images need to be normalized and the labels need to be one-hot encoded. You'll get to apply what you learned and build a convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers. At the end, you'll get to see your neural network's predictions on the sample images.
