# Convolutional Neural Networks - Optimum Max-Pooling Design

## Project: Capstone Proposal and Capstone Project

## Introduction
The Capstone is a two-staged project. The first is the proposal component, where I received valuable feedback about my project idea for Optimizing the Max-Pooling Design in CNN classifiers. 

In the capstone project, we will try and compare three different CCN methods to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The dataset will need to be preprocessed, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. For all models we will normalize the images, one-hot encode the labels, build a convolutional layer, utilize max pool layer in three different ways: standard, fractional, and no pooling. Then will apply the fully connected layer. At the end, we will see their accuracy and loss performance on predicting the sample images. 

### Getting the project files

The project files can be found in public GitHub repo, in the image-classification folder. You can download the files from there, but it's better to clone the repository to your computer
Please note this project is written in Python 3.x.
